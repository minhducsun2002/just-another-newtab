# `just-another-new-tab`

Just another new tab page for Chromium-based browsers.

Experimental support for Firefox.

Cloned from (and based on) [`minhducsun2002/less-sucks-newtab`](https://github.com/minhducsun2002/less-sucks-newtab),
which I forked from
[`ducphanduyagentp/less-sucks-newtab/`](https://github.com/ducphanduyagentp/less-sucks-newtab).
